                <p> <span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep
                    within everyone, even
                    though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people
                    are
                    just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much
                    less
                    than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing
                    respect.

                <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is
                    showing
                    someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are
                    valued.
